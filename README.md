# Candidate Elimination Algorithm

This project implements the Candidate Elimination Algorithm in Machine Learning
using Python.

## Algorithm
Candidate Elimination is a concept learning algorithm that finds:
- The most specific hypothesis (S)
- The most general hypothesis (G)

based on training examples.

## Files in this Repository
- candidate_elimination.py : Python implementation of the algorithm
- 2.csv : Training dataset
- README.md : Project documentation

## Dataset Attributes
- sky
- airtemp
- humidity
- wind
- water
- forecast
- enjoysport (target)

## How to Run
1. Upload the files to Google Colab / local Python environment
2. Run the Python script
3. The algorithm prints the final specific and general hypotheses

## Output
The program outputs:
- Final Specific Hypothesis
- Final General Hypothesis
